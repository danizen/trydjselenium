Can dynamically download geckodriver from here:

 - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest

Which redirects to here:

 - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.21.0

From the last component of this, we can determine the version, and infer where to go next:

 - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.21.0/geckodriver-v0.21.0-linux32.tar.gz
 - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.21.0/geckodriver-v0.21.0-linux64.tar.gz
 - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.21.0/geckodriver-v0.21.0-win32.zip

And so on...
